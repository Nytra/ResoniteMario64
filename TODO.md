# TODO:

- Add way to have multiple instances (Dictionary of World to Instance) -- Not possible atm, due to libsm64 limitations
- Audio Volume Settings for Non-Modded
- Fix Renderer SKill issue (UNKNOWN????? O_O) -- Seems to be somewhat fixed, but still needs investigation?
- Figure out better Syncing of values (StateFlags)
- Maybe Implement? Generate a Mario Texture from libsm64 instead of resd -- needs a way to have a Local Texture, look into Render Textures?
- Implement fallback for MaxAnimatedMarios into resdb mario, uses IsShown var
